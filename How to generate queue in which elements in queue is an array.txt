To generate a queue in which elements are arrays, you can use the built-in queue module in Python. Specifically, you can use the Queue class from this module, which allows you to create a queue that holds elements of any data type, including arrays.


import queue

array_queue = queue.Queue()

array1 = [1, 2, 3]
array2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
array3 = [True, False]

array_queue.put(array1)
array_queue.put(array2)
array_queue.put(array3)

while not array_queue.empty():
    array = array_queue.get()
    print(array)

Output:

[1, 2, 3]
['a', 'b', 'c']
[True, False]

In this example, we used the queue.Queue() class to create a queue that can hold arrays of any length or data type. We added three arrays to the queue and then retrieved and printed them using a while loop until the queue was empty.
